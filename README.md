# Quantum Circuit Optimizer

Optimization tool for quantum computing aimed at electronic strucure calculations.

TODO:
  - Add control gates X
  - Add rotation gates X 
  - Control gate optimization
  - Add gate transformations
  - Add psi4 handling to get integrals
  - Add 0 and 1 occupation convention for ladder operators and their products. X


Changes from master:
  - Controlled operations
  - Rotation operations
  - Qiskit-like implementation of gates
  - Printing gate per gate for each qubit to easier handle controlled gates
    - Negative: Have to reimplement identity gates in between
  - Transformationis and optimization modules
  -
